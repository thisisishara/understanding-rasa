### Why the heck am I doing this?
This repository is for taking rasa 3.6.18 apart and understand its components for educational purposes including but not limited to:
- how rasa utilizes the CLI
- how sanic is running with the http endpoints and websockets
- how rasa tracker is working
- how actions are baked-in
- how rasa properly manages dependencies
- how to properly utilize docker for a python project
- and more...  

## How the heck am I gonna do this?
I'll be doing most of the tests offline so there won't be many commits, the repo is just there so that I can study the codebase. Could have done it with just a local copy of the repo but you know, I just had to create a repo :D

## What have I leart?
- [x] nothing yet, still 6 feet deep in the codebase tryna figure things out myself
